## How to contribute ? ü§î 

1. ### First, make sure you have a GitHub account.

   - If you do not have a GitHub account, you can create one by visiting the GitHub website and signing up for a free account.
2. ### Fork the repository on GitHub.

   - To fork a repository, navigate to the repository you want to contribute to and click the `Fork` button in the top right corner. This creates a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

3. ### Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

   - To clone the repository, navigate to your forked copy of the repository on GitHub and click the `Clone or download` button. `Copy the URL` that is provided.
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the repository.
   - Run the command `git clone [URL]`, replacing [URL] with the URL you copied from GitHub. This creates a local copy of the repository on your machine.

4. ### Create a new branch for your changes.

   - After you've cloned the repository, navigate into the repository's directory using the command `cd [repository name]`.
   - Run the command `git branch [branch name]` to create a new branch with the name you provided.
   - To switch to your newly created branch use the command `git checkout [branch name]`

5. ### Make your changes and commit them to your local branch.

   - Make the changes you want to contribute to the repository. This can include adding new files, modifying existing files, or deleting files.
   - After making your changes, you need to commit them to your local branch.
   - Run the command `git add [file name]` to stage the changes for commit. Repeat the command for all the files you've changed.
   - Run the command `git commit -m [commit message]` to commit the changes. The commit message should briefly describe the changes you've made.

6. ### Push your local branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

   - After committing your changes, you need to push them to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Run the command `git push origin [branch name]` to push your local branch to your forked repository.

7. ### Open a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository.

   - Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub and you should see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on it.
   - Fill out the pull request form, describing the changes you've made and why they should be included in the original repository.
   - Submit the pull request.
